The Amount.Requested boxplot shows that the mean requested is around 10,000 dollars and 75% of loans were between
around 6,000 dollars to 17,000 dollars. 
Looking at the histogram shows that the data has a longer right tail, with a small amount of loans that are around 3x or 
more then the mean loan requested. This is because the data is bounded by 1,000 on the left, as the data seems to show
that is the smallest loan you can request.
A notable differene here between this and loan amount given is that many loans did not recieve any funding and has a value 
of zero dollars.
The QQ plot shows a high degree of normaility, which was also true for the amount given.
